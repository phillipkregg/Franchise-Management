Franchise Management Tool
=========================

### This is a work in progress.

It allows for the creation of a 'Franchise Set' which contains 'Franchises' and 'Users'.

There are tools for creating, updating, and deleting both Franchises and Users.  

Soon there will be a way to add 'Features' to a Franchise Set.
